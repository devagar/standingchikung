### About

Since 1998 Iâ€™ve embraced the the study of the subject of stillness.

I practice and teach Standing Chi Kung known in China as Zhan Zhuang (Pronounces as Jam Jong)

I believe that more important then all the theory that you can present in a class and the lineage I represent, the core challenge for me has a teacher is to create consistency, effectiveness and autonomy in those who seek my classes.

Know also as daily practice.

I live and teach in Lisbon, Portugal.

This blog contains original and translated texts from a blog I host in Portuguese since 2008 - [Zhan Zhuang Chi Kung - A Arte do Cultivo da Quietude](http://devagar.org)
