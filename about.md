## About

Since 1998 I've embraced the study of the subject of stillness.

I practice and teach Standing Chi Kung known in China as Zhan Zhuang (Pronounces as Jam Jong).

I believe that more important then all the theory that can be present in
a class and the lineage that each teacher represents, the core challenge
for me has a teacher is to create consistency, effectiveness and autonomy
in the practice of those who seek my classes.

I live and teach in Lisbon, Portugal.

This blog contains original and translated texts from a blog I host in Portuguese since 2008 - [Zhan Zhuang Chi Kung - A Arte do Cultivo da Quietude](http://devagar.org)
