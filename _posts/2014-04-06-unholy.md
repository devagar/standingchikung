Since more then 20 journeys ago I elected Amsterdam as one of the most powerful places for developing my Chi Kung Training. 

And it's one of my second homes in the planet besides Portugal. 

What attracts me here it's the combination between the sacred and the unholy. 

Its common to feel the smell of cannabis in almost every corner, as you can find a Buddhist temple just in the vicinities of a coffee shop.

In the Red Light district one of the most truistic places in town sex shops and churches from several religions live in what looks as a perfect harmony. 

But after all what as this to do with the practice?

I found out that if you transform the contrasts and antagonisms in something nourishing you can find your three square meters for your practice anywhere in the world. 

Enjoy your practice.
