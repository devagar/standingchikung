A Sacred Place is where it's possible to disconnect and create a panoramic view our daily affairs.

A Sacred Place can be created using three main ingredients.

+ Disconnection
+ Ritual 
+ Contemplation 

**Disconnection** it's not only about switching off the mobile phone.

+ It's also to decide that you don't speak about work or surf the social networks at the table or in the bedroom. 
+ That in the car you don't switch on the radio or at home you don't switch on the TV just to "keep you company". 
+ That in moments that you have to wait you don't jump in a compulsive way to your mobile phone to see if you have a new SMS or email everytime you encounter silence or boredom . 

**Disconnection creates the ability to choose the space and importance that the world can have in our lives**

**Ritual** doesn't have to do just with religious ceremonies but it is also actions in a certain sequence that leads to bigger purpose.

+ It's cleaning the kitchen and get the utensils ready before you start to cook.
+ It's burning an incense stick before your Chi Kung practice or meditation.
+ It's cleaning the desk before staring to write, paint, draw or answering emails.
+ It's putting on some comfortable clothes and relax in the sofa in the first 10 minutes after you arrive home. 

**Contemplation** it's the opposite from focus.

+ When we observe a tree we don't see only the tree. We observe the shape, the texture of the trunk, the color of the leaves and how they move with the wind. 
+ At the seaside we listen to the sound of the waves, we feel the wind on the face and the salty smell that it brings. 
+ While walking in the city we look forward at the horizon and not down. We walk slowly and in a conscious way. We are aware without judging images, sounds and smells. 
+ At a meal we feel the food that we chew and the different tastes, smells and even memories that it brings. 

We can travel to a distant country in search of a sacred place our learn to recognize this three ingredients in the places and moments that make part of our day. 

Once found and cultivated these places bring time, space and resourses so wherever we may roam. We can be aware of the present moment but also the sacred that these moments have to offer us.
