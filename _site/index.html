      	<h2>Formality in the practice</h2>
      	<p>If you are invited to a party where you don’t know most of the people and there is a strict dress code the feeling in the body is different from a beach party where you know everyone,</p>

<p>In the later you get a relaxed feeling in the body and you may also don’t want leave this party and the question is “when do I leave” in opposite to the first example which would be “can I leave now?” </p>

<p>When you stroll on the daily routine of exercises it´s easy to get formal and that means to transform your training into a check list. </p>

<p>When that happens the benefits of the training may just fade as more and more tension builds up during the practice. Because you must do and perform instead of just show up and enjoy. </p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that the training should be something without form or goal. </p>

<p>This is also important to get consistent, but both of the universes can bring many benefits for the practice instead of just choosing one of them. </p>

<p>If you are just the kind of the check list freak with always so many things to practice and so little time practice once a week choose to do the three most relaxing exercises that you are found of. Choose to do less to achieve more.</p>

<p>If you are just the beach party Chi Kung student, once a week just sit five minutes before. Take note of a few exercises that you would like to do and then make them happen. </p>

<p>The challenge of a long standing practice is to use both as tools that benefit your training. </p>

<p>Always remember that formality can block but also shapes the Chi, as informality it can make the practice quite blurry but also can be an wonderful relaxing opportunity. </p>

<p>Enjoy your practice.   </p>
